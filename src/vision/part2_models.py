    def get_kernel(self, cutoff_frequency: int) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Returns a Gaussian kernel using the specified cutoff frequency.

        PyTorch requires the kernel to be of a particular shape in order to
        apply it to an image. Specifically, the kernel needs to be of shape
        (c, 1, k, k) where c is the # channels in the image. Start by getting a
        2D Gaussian kernel using your implementation from Part 1, which will be
        of shape (k, k). Then, let's say you have an RGB image, you will need to
        turn this into a Tensor of shape (3, 1, k, k) by stacking the Gaussian
        kernel 3 times.

        Args
            cutoff_frequency: int specifying cutoff_frequency
        Returns
            kernel: Tensor of shape (c, 1, k, k) where c is # channels

        HINTS:
        - You will use the create_Gaussian_kernel_2D() function from part1.py in
          this function.
        - Since the # channels may differ across each image in the dataset,
          make sure you don't hardcode the dimensions you reshape the kernel
          to. There is a variable defined in this class to give you channel
          information.
        - You can use np.reshape() to change the dimensions of a numpy array.
        - You can use np.tile() to repeat a numpy array along specified axes.
        - You can use torch.Tensor() to convert numpy arrays to torch Tensors.
